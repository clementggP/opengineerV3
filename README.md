# Opengineer website
This is my first ever "real" project in IT. I tried to quickly pull out a website for a consultancy business i was setting up in south America. 
I hosted the website on DigitalOcean for some time. 
The business did not work out, but i have not heart in deleting this code source. So i simply keep it as archived for now.
